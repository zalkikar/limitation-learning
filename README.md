This repository houses the code for the NYU Deep Reinforcement Learning Fall 2020 Final Project by Rahul Zalkikar and Noah Kasmanoff, "Limitation Learning: Capturing Adverse Dialog with GAIL". 




We apply generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) to produce a proxy for the reward function present in a basic conversation, using the Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus. We apply imitation learning to craft coherent replies to the input utterance. Thus, the actor network is Seq2Seq w/ Attention pre-trained with imitation learning.

Down the line, our focus is on an auxilary objective of GAIL, using a discriminator network as a proxy for a reward function.

We hope that after training the policy and discriminator networks to equilibrium, we may use this proxy reward function as a way to probe black box language models with direct feedback. We can then additionally feed inputs to publicly available conversational AI, extract a response, and pass this through the proxy reward to gain a better intuition on that language model's behavior. 

This work is just the beginning. We emphasize that GAIL is a method of imitation, not inverse reinforcement learning. This distinction is important in that we cannot recover the underlying reward function of the system, but instead a proxy based on imitation. We consider the application of more advanced techniques such as guided cost learning a worthwhile next step if GAIL succeeds.
